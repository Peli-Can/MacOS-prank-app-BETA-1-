# MacOS-prank-app-BETA-1-

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Recommendation: Change the title and picture of the application to make it look more convincing, maybe find a nice wallpaper and make that the icon/picture and name it something relevant. e.g - a photo of an Audi R8 as the photo and the title to be audi-r8-hd-wallpaper_1 .

There is an extremely low chance that you will have any side-effects left on your Mac when opening this on your or anyone else’s computer. This is really as stable as it gets. If you fuck up your/someone else’s computer; I take no responsibility. But realistically, nothing serious is going to happen.
NOTE: To open, you may need to right click, then click open.
If you plan to open it on your own computer please, for your sake, save and backup any files you do not want to lose.
I promise that any files found here are not malware. I'm not that smart to code a real virus lol :p

If the whole "Shift button always being pressed thing" starts to just get seriously annoying or something seriously bad happens, restart your mac.

Current Support:
OS X/MacOS

Please tell me if there are any errors of some sort that prevent the application from running, as I will try my absolute hardest to fix said error.
Note that I am open to suggestions to make this app "Funner" lets just say.
The project is technically in beta, in case you were wondering.
